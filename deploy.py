response_list = ["""Dear LinkedIn friends,

Today, I've made a decision that is both difficult and necessary. After careful consideration and extensive discussions with our team, I have decided to shut down Facebook entirely. 

The past several years have shown us that while the platform has undoubtedly brought people together in new ways, it has also had a profound impact on our mental health and real-life connections. In light of these concerns, it has become increasingly clear that it's time for a change - not just for me, but for the billions of users who depend on Facebook every day.

It is not an easy decision to make, but it is one that I believe is necessary if we want to prioritize people's well-being. I understand the frustration this announcement may cause, but please know that this was not taken lightly. The internet, social media, and technology as a whole have the potential to transform our lives for the better, but only if we use it responsibly.

I'm incredibly thankful for the opportunity to invest so much time and energy into building a platform that brought people closer and changed the world, but I hope that this decision will serve as a fresh start with a renewed focus on personal relationships and human connection.

Thank you to all of you who have been a part of this journey. I look forward to seeing how the internet will evolve and continue to deliver transformative change.

Sincerely,
Mark
